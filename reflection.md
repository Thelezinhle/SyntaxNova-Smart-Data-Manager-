# Reflection

## Overview
This project, **SYNTAX Data Manager**, required us to build a complete internal data management ecosystem using Power Apps, Azure SQL, Python ETL, and Power BI. The goal was to centralize business data, support CRUD operations, clean raw datasets, and deliver analytics dashboards. The work demanded technical coordination across development, database design, and analytics.

## What Went Well

### Team Collaboration
Each team member worked within a clearly defined role:
- **Lerato Matamela** handled data cleaning, Python ETL, SQL data loading, and analytics.
- **Thelezinhle Buthelezi** designed the database structure, ER diagram, and DFD.
- **Thato Rapholo** created the Power App, built navigation, and implemented CRUD logic.

This separation of responsibilities made the workflow efficient and reduced confusion.

### ETL and Data Cleaning
The dataset was successfully cleaned and transformed:
- Fixed inconsistent statuses  
- Removed duplicates and blank rows  
- Standardized data types  
- Added calculated fields such as total amounts and profits  

The final dataset loaded into Azure SQL without structural issues.

### System Architecture
The ERD and DFD aligned well with the solution design. Normalizing the tables created a stable database that supported Power Apps forms and Power BI
